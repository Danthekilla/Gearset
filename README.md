# Gearset

XNA / MonoGame programmer? Say hello to Gearset.

Game development processes are different from any other type of software process. Game state data usually changes dramatically every 16~33 milliseconds, and usually programmers need to be aware of what's going on under the hood in real time. Gearset is the product that enables just that, it makes the programmer (and everyone else watching) aware of how the game is behaving internally, having this information available and being able to modify it in real-time have proven to be an important edge towards development efficiency, debugging costs reduction and ultimately making better games.

Gearset is completely independent of whichever engine or framework you're using or not using (as long as its XNA or MonoGame based). Simply add 3 lines of code to your game and you're set. If you are just starting with XNA or MonoGame, Gearset will give you the boost you need. 

## Supported Platforms

Anything that XNA or MonoGame support really but some features will be limited to desktop platforms.

## Installation
* Build from source - use *master* for a stable code base or *development* for bleeding edge.
* Use one of the available [Nuget packages] (https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Gearset)
* Use the older version binaries directly from [The Complot](http://www.thecomplot.com/index.html)

## Quick Start

* Please see the Samples/SampleGame project for an idea of how to setup Gearset.
* Head over to the [WIKI](https://github.com/PumpkinPaul/Gearset/wiki) for more documentation (coming soon).
* An older [Gearset User Guide] (http://www.thecomplot.com/gearsetguide.html) is also available.
